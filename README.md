Simple Mining Game: Luck and Strategy in the Carnival Mining Arena

✨ About the Game
Tonnect Carnival Mining is a simple game project that simulates the mining experience in a festive carnival-like environment. Players will interact with game machines that give out random prizes, where the goal is to collect as many prizes as possible with strategy and a little luck.
